# Hyperledger Fabric

Hyperledger Fabric is a blockchain framework that provides a modular architecture for developing enterprise-grade blockchain solutions. It is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing organizations to deploy and manage their own blockchain networks. Fabric enables developers to create smart contracts in various programming languages and provides a range of tools to manage and interact with the blockchain network. This document provides an overview of the Fabric application stack and instructions for installing the necessary prerequisite software to get started with Fabric.

## Getting Started

The Fabric application stack has five layers:

- **Prerequisite Software**: the base layer needed to run the software.
- **Fabric**: the Fabric executables to run a Fabric network.
- **Contract APIs**: to develop smart contracts executed on a Fabric Network.
- **Application APIs**: to develop blockchain applications.
- **The Application**: the blockchain application will utilize the Application SDK to call smart contracts running on a Fabric network.

## Prerequisite Software:

### For Linux

#### Git
Install the latest version of git if it is not already installed:

```sudo apt-get install git```


#### cURL
#### Docker
#### Docker Compose
#### Go
#### JQ
#### Git For Windos (Optional)
